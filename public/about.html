<h1>About Me:</h1>
<p>Hi there! I'm Rom√°rio, and I'm a beginner web developer.</p>
 
<p>
  I'm still learning web development and, currently, I'm in the early stages of completing Dr. Angela Yu's: 
  <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/">The Complete Web Development Bootcamp</a><br />
  through Udemy.com, and I am very happy with what I have created so far with the help of the amazing Dr. Yu and her course.<br />
</p>

<p>
  I come from a background in fashion design, and have a Bachelor's degree in it. I went down this specific path, <br />
  because I am a creative at heart and I always try to find ways to express that creativity, so, fashion seemed like a good outlet. <br />
  I worked in the fashion industry for a bit, but felt that it wasn't scratching the itch I needed it to, 
  so I started branching out into other fields.<br />
  Since then I have dipped my toes in to a few other fields, such as sales, customer support, baking, and now web development!
