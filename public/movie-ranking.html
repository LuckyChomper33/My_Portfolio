<h1>The best movies, like, ever! According to me.</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies from within my lifetime:</h2>

<hr />

<h3>1. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</h3>
<p>I am absolutely obsessed with the Harry Potter franchise.<br />
If you're not, you are a filthy muggle.</p>

<h3>2. Warcraft</h3>
<p>Growing up, I was playing World of Warcraft constantly.<br />
This movie scratched an itch I didn't even know I had.<br />
The visuals are just...*Chef's kiss*.</p>

<h3>3. The Lord of the Rings: The fellowship of the ring</h3>
<p>What more do I need to say?<br />
Nothing!</p>
